Full spread security operations interconnected and automated tools suite using only open source software.  Built upon scalable computing concepts, each layer of function contains a number of devices that can scale out indepently of the other layers.  Multiple nodes are leveraged for load balancing where possible, at the network and hardware hypervisor layer as well asthe software processing and database performance later.
